                  It was the end of the Halloween
                  <input type="text" id="event" /> night. All the people,
                  children and parents were going to
                  <input type="text" id="place" /> . All were wearing Halloween
                  costumes. Chris, a 5-year-old boy,
                  <input type="text" id="activity" /> alone on a bench by his
                  home. His grandparents had slept, but he was still waiting for
                  his elder brothers, sisters, and other family members to
                  return. As he was sitting, he found himself captivated by a
                  group of
                  <!--radio buttons-->
                  <div class="d-inline-block ml-1">
                    <input type="radio" id="cats" value="cats" name="animal" />
                    <label for="cats" class="mr-1">cats</label>
                    <input
                      id="spiders"
                      type="radio"
                      name="animal"
                      value="spiders"
                    />
                    <label for="spiders">spiders</label>
                  </div>
                  that drew his attention. Suddenly, he sees a horrible,
                  ghost-looking man near
                  <input type="text" id="nearby_place" />. Chris says hi to the
                  scary-looking man but fails to get a proper response. Then the
                  ghost-looking man walks towards him, and Chris kindly asks
                  him, "Mr, where are my brothers?". The man keeps his silence.
                  Even though it is an awkward situation, Chris enjoys ghost
                  looking man's company, and then he asks to borrow his costume.
                  But the man has different intentions. The eyes of the man
                  suddenly turn into scary red as it was a dreadful
                  <input type="text" id="creature" />. He wants to catch him!
                  Suddenly, a <input type="text" id="count" /> of people pass by
                  them. Ghost-looking-man was going to but couldn't
                  <input type="text" id="verb" /> him, decided to hide himself
                  behind a <input type="text" id="thing" />. Chris now knows
                  something is up with the man. Suddenly, an old man from behind
                  calls up Chris in a familiar voice. The old man turns out to
                  be Chris's <input type="text" id="relative" />. He hears
                  Chris's cries, grabs him by the arm, and then they both return
                  home <input type="text" id="emotion" />.
